### Previous works

- **[Predicting Covid Vaccine Side effects](https://github.com/HaileyHao/Predicting-Covid-Vax-Side-Effects)**: A machine learning project in R to predict whether the patient recovered from the self-reported Covid-19 Vaccine side effect. I fit and tuned 4 types supervised machine learning models (Penalized Logistic Regression Model, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline, Random Forest Model, Penalized Single layer Neural Network Model, as representatives of linear models, regression splines models, tree models and neural networks), and achieved 75% prediction accuracy with a random forest model (min_n = 23).

- **[Intermedia agenda setting effects of mainstream media](https://github.com/HaileyHao/Agenda-setting/blob/main/Intermedia%20agenda%20setting%20effects%20of%20mainstream%20media.pdf)**: A study on the influence mainstreet media potentially has on social media attention and sentiment on Covid Vaccines. New York Times API and Twitter API were used to retrieve historical records of posts on both platform in the similar timeframe, and sentiment features developed with NLP, used for linear regression modeling.

- **An examination of married Chinese women’s social role preference**: A personal research on Chinese married women's social role preference with multiple multinomial logistic models.

- **[Measuring the Integration and Network Effect of the UN SDGs](https://github.com/HaileyHao/G5055_Practicum_Project2):**  A project where we developed whole network models of the UN Sustainable Development Goals based on the correlation between 100+ variables; Visualized networks, conducted social network analysis, and delivered presentations to UN officials about the trade-offs and secondary benefits of SDG-orientated policy enactment, as a reference for optimizing investment decisions towards the utmost joint effect.

  - [Blog on the UN official site](https://www.jointsdgfund.org/article/measuring-integration-and-network-effect-sdgs) 
      
- **[FBIwanted API Wrapper](https://github.com/HaileyHao/FBIwanted)**: A FBIwanted API wrapper that allows retrieving datasets of FBI wanted people by appearance features or administrative regions, as well as downloading wanted posters to see the photos.  

- **[Visualizing Covid-19 Vaccine Side Effect Reports](https://github.com/HaileyHao/Group_L_VaccineSideeffect)**: A visualization in R of the side effect reports from a WHO database to understand the side effects of different Covid-19 vaccines. Conducted text analysis and sentiment analysis on relevant Tweets, and presented interactive maps.         
<!-- - **[Predicting Covid-19 Vaccine Side Effect Reports]()**:  -->

<!--     - An NLP project on modern music lyrics, exploring the sentiment of songs of different genres;-->
<!--     - An Machine Learning/Deep Learning Project on predciting customer orders based on their previous purchases.-->
